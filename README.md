# kanaguessr

[kanaguessr](https://kanaguessr.taevas.xyz/) is a webpage where a character appears in [hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana), [katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana), or [romaji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Japanese), and you have to guess its equivalent in one of those syllabaries

you may use it to train yourself with [typing in japanese](https://www.coscom.co.jp/learnjapanese801/msime_win10_en1.html), by constantly switching through three different syllabaries

or you may simply use it to test your knowledge of hiraganas and katakanas by typing their equivalent in romaji
